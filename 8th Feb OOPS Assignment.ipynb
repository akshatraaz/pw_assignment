    "1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.- Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts. It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Real world example of abstraction is in banking system. When we go to the bank for deposite or withdraw money. We fill up the form for that and take only that necessary step which we need. We shouldn't need to know, what internal machanism to work for complete this process."

    "Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. \n",
    "In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.\n",

    "needs the records of sales in 2022, then he/ she cannot directly access it."
