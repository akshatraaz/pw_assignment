    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Relational Databases: Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that stores and retrieves data without using traditional relational database structures. They are often used to manage large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, images, and videos. Non-relational databases can handle data that does not fit neatly into a fixed schema or structure, and are often designed for horizontal scalability and high availability.\n",

    "1. Handling large volumes of unstructured data: MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, images, and videos, that do not fit neatly into a traditional table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High availability and scalability: MongoDB is designed to be highly available and scalable, allowing you to add or remove nodes as needed to handle changes in traffic or data volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rapid development and prototyping: MongoDB allows for flexible and iterative development, enabling faster prototyping and development cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cloud-based applications: MongoDB is often used in cloud-based applications due to its ability to scale horizontally across multiple nodes and regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Real-time analytics: MongoDB can handle real-time analytics and reporting, making it a good choice for applications that require real-time data insights.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Powerful query language: MongoDB's query language is rich and expressive, allowing you to perform complex queries and aggregations on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing and aggregation: MongoDB provides a variety of indexing options to help you optimize your queries and speed up your application. It also includes powerful aggregation pipelines to perform complex data transformations and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Real-time data processing: MongoDB is designed to handle real-time data processing and analytics, making it a good choice for applications that require real-time insights into data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Geospatial data handling: MongoDB includes built-in support for geospatial data, allowing you to easily store and query location-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Flexible data modeling: MongoDB allows for flexible and iterative data modeling, making it easy to update your schema and handle changes in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Security: MongoDB provides a range of security features, including authentication, encryption, and access control, to help you keep your data secure.\n"
