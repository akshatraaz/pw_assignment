    "\n",
    "## Artificial Intelligence With Example.\n",
    "Ans - Artificial Intelligence is the similation of human intelligence process by machine, especially computer systems. Specific application of AI include expert system, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Artificial Intelligence are: \n",
    "1. Self Driving Car \n",
    "2. Robots \n",
    "3. Smart Assistance\n",
    "4. Virtual travel Booking Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Explaination with Example.\n",
    "Ans - Machine Learning is an technique where computer learn themself from their past experiences. Machine Learning algorithm use computational method to learn information directly from data relying on a predetermined equation as a model.\n",
    " Here are some example of Machine Learning:\n",
    " 1. Recomendation system\n",
    " 2. Speech & Image recognization\n",
    " 3. Prediction\n",
    " 4. Traffic alerts using Google map\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Deep learning Definition with examples\n",
    " Ans - Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost.\n",
    " Examples of Deep learning:\n",
    " 1. Object Detection\n",
    " 2. Chatbots\n",
    " \n",
    "Q2. Supervised Machine Learning with its Example.\n",
    "Ans - Supervised machine learning is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithm that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed to the model, it adjust its weight until the model hasbeen fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised machine learning help organization solve for a variety real world problem at scale, such as classifying spam in a seperate folder fromyour inbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eample of Supervised Machine Learning:\n",
    "1. Predict House plan\n",
    "2. Random Forest for Classification\n",
    "3. Linear regression for regression problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Unsupervised learning with its example.\n",
    "Ans - Unsupervised Learning also known as Unsupervised Machine Learning, uses machine learning algorithm to analyze and cluster unlabled datasets. These algorithm discover hidden pattern or data groupings without the needs for human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Unsupervisd Learning:\n",
    "1. Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "2. Customer Segmentation\n",
    "3. Cross Selling Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Differences between AI, ML, DL and DS.\n",
    "Ans - AI : AI is an Artificial Intelligence which is an application that can perform their own task without human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ML : Full form of ML is Machine Learning, it provides stats tool to analyze, visualize,predictive model and Forecasting.\n",
    " \n",
    "     DL: Dl is known as Deep learning wich is the subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural network attempt to simulate the behaviour of the human brain.\n",
    "     Ds: Data Science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is amultidisciplinary approach that combines principales and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence and computer engineering to analyze large amount of data. \n",
    "     \n",
    "Q5. Main difference between Supervised, Unsupervise and Semi Supervised Learning.\n",
    "Ans - Supervised Learning :- Supervised Machine Learning is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms accurately.\n",
    "There are two types of Supervised Machine Learning: 1. Classification  2. Regression\n",
    "    Unsupervised Learning :- Unsupervised Machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled dataswts.\n",
    "    Semi-Supervised Learning :- Semi - Supervised is a combination of Supervised machine learning and Unsupervised Machine Learning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. What is train, test and validation split and importance of each tearm.\n",
    "    Ans - In machine learning, data splitting is typically done to avoid overfitting. That is an instance where a machine learning model fits its training data too well and fails to reliably fit additional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data in a machine learning model is typically taken and split into three or four sets. The three sets commonly used are the training set, the dev set and the testing set:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The training set is the portion of data used to train the model. The model should observe and learn from the training set, optimizing any of its parameters.\n",
    "    2. The dev set is a data set of examples used to change learning process parameters. It is also called the cross-validation or model validation set. This set of data has the goal of ranking the model's accuracy and can help with model selection.\n",
    "    3.The testing set is the portion of data that is tested in the final model and is compared against the previous sets of data. The testing set acts as an evaluation of the final mode and algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q7. Unsupervised Learning used in anomaly detection\n",
    "     Ans - Anomaly detection techniques of unsupervised nature assume that normal data points occur considerably more frequently than anomalous data points. This assumption is used to classify data points that occur less frequently as anomalies. Unsupervised techniques assign each data point a score instead of a label. Like:\n",
    "     1. Load the dataset\n",
    "     2. Check available model\n",
    "     3. Plot Model\n",
    "     4. Save the model\n",
    "     5. Load the Model\n",
    "     6. Score on unseen Data\n",
